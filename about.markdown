I am a software developer with a background in statistics.

I primarily write software in Golang and C. I am beginning to play with Rust.

I am the lead developer for the [Factom Asset Tokens
Daemon](https://github.com/Factom-Asset-Tokens/fatd), a daemon that adds
tokenization on top of the Factom Blockchain. I am in the process of adding
Wasm smart contracts.

Previously, I worked on the design of a Linux based, cloud-connected,
industrial control system. I also have professional experience with
implementing serial communication protocols in both Linux, and in
register-level firmware for MSP430 and AVR.
